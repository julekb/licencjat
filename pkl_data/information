Information about files in this directory:

1. data_all.pkl

	It's a list which includes all data from surveys. Every cell contains a pandas DataFrame with:
		- index [0-30:1]
		- sim_score [1-100] (it's a raw answer from suvrey)
		- stimulus (relates to the stimuli presented in survey)
		- converted [7-207] (it's a converted sim_score)
		- deviation  (converted - stimulus)

2. avg_data.pkl					(named avg_mean_sd.pkl before)
	It's a pandas DataFrame which contains some general information about participants' answers, that is:
		- index [0-30:1]
		- stimulus
		- mean (mean participants' converted response)
		- SD (standard deviation)

3. ind_models.pkl
	It's a pandas MultiIndex DataFrame. A file with individual models for linear regressions(regr, regr_ey, regr_log) and other models(nb1NN, nb2NN, nb3NN)
	- multiindex:
		- agents [0-243:1] (it may vary due to exclusions of some participants)
		- iteration [0-30:1] (the models were created with use the  of leave-one-out cross_validation. For every agent, there are 31 models based on 30 answers)
		To access to a particular cell the method .loc() is recommended
	- models [regr, regr_ey, regr_log, nb1NN, nb2NN, nb3NN]
	- inverted models [inv regr, inv regr_ey, inv regr_log, inv nb1NN, inv nb2NN, inv nb3NN]
	- remain [a value] (it's a value that was left over during the cross-validation)

4. df_err_[model_type].pkl		6 files; size: 553MB each
	It' a pandas MultiIndex DataFrame. It's a part of DataFrame generated by script save_errors_script() in compare_models.py file.
		- multiindex:
			- agent A [0-243:1]
			- agent B [B's index+1 -243:1]
			- iteration [0-30:1]
		- d_A [ model_name d_A] (it's  A_y - A_model(B_model_inv(B_y)) )
		- d_B (respectively)

5. df_err_nomodel.pkl
	It's a pandas MultiIndex DataFrame. A file relates to the same DataFrame as the one above.
		- multiindex
		- A_y-B_y  [no model error] (A_y should be equivalent to A[remain])
